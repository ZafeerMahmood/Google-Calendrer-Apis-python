# Google Calendar APIs Python Integration
This repository contains simple Python scripts to interact with the Google Calendar APIs. The google_calendar.py module provides functions for utilizing the Google Calendar API, while the google.py script serves as a testing example.

# Setup and Run
To run the scripts, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

bash
Copy code
```bash
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client google-auth-oauthlib
```
Run the google.py script
Copy code

```bash
py google.py
```
Please note that you need to enable the Google Calendar API for this integration to work. Follow Google's documentation to enable the API and obtain your API credentials.

Future Plans
This project is designed to be easily extendable. The modular structure allows for future expansion and integration, such as creating a Flask web service to provide Google Calendar functionality over the web.
